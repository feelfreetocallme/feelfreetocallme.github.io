        p We can talk for 5 minutes or we can talk for hours. I promise to give you at least half an hour of my time.
        p If I’m already on a call, leave me a voicemail/text with your name and number. We can try to work out a different time.
        p Call me if we’ve never spoken before or if we haven’t spoken in a decade or if you used to hate me or you’re my best friend we or share blood relatives.
        p We can talk about anything you want. 
        p We can talk about happy things.
        p We can talk about bummers.

        h3 Who am I calling?
        p My name’s Logan. I’m a 20-something web-developer living on the West Coast of the US. I move a lot so I don’t always find it easy to make friends and keep in touch with the ones I got. 
        p  This might not work. People might not call me, but I promise to show up if you do.
